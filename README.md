AmazFit-TextViewer
==================

This application is a simple text viewer for Huami's WOS2

It is a simple fork of [TEdit](https://github.com/ATryder/TEdit), with some layout modifications and text editing functionalities disabled.

Works fine on an Huami Amazfit Pace, should also work with the Stratos model.
